This was all tested on a 64-bit Windows 11 computer.

PREREQUISITES:

- Elixir (Tested with 1.16.2) -- https://elixir-lang.org/install.html
- Erlang 26 (Prerequisite for Elixir 1.16.2)

STEP BY STEP GUIDE TO SETUP PROJECT:

STEP 0 - 

// Extract the Web-Engineer-Presentation-Main anywhere on your computer.

STEP 1 - 

// Go to the folder "Web-Engineer-Presentation-Main" in your code editor and open a Terminal

-- Alternatively, you can just open a terminal and travel to "Web-Engineer-Presentation-Main"

// Once inside the terminal, type "cd we_app" to get into the main application folder.

STEP 2 -

// Type "mix deps.get" within the terminal to get all dependencies for the project.

STEP 3 -

// Once all dependencies are sorted out, you can start the server by typing "mix phx.server"

STEP 4 -

// Once the server is up, you can test the page by editing the url manually with you utm_source and campaign
// If you click the skull below, you can share Boney with the current utm_source and utm_campaign
// For each visit, full_url, utm_source and utm_campaign get stored in the database with timestamps.

EXTRAS -

- For checking the Database, I personally use DB Browser for SQLite since its quite simple to use.
